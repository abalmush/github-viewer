# Simple Github Repositories Viewer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started
Before starting the app, we should provide two environment variables. The easiest way is creating the `.env` file in the root directory. Template `.env.tmp` already exists.

###### Any Github user:`REACT_APP_GITHUB_USER`

###### Github token: `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN`

Follow the steps in [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a token.


In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
